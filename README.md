## Sparse bundle adjustment
Sparse bundle adjustment is widely used in many computer vision applications. In this project, we develop a method for performing bundle adjustments using the L1 norm. The method performs better for both synthetically generated and real data sets in the presence of outliers or Laplacian noise compared with the L2 norm bundle adjustment, and the method is efficient among the state of the art L1 minimization methods.
